        <p>Held in commemoration of Saint Joseph in Valencia, this bucket list fiesta draws back to the 
            Middle Ages. At that time, carpenters had the tradition to celebrate the arrival of spring 
            on 19th March by burning pieces of wood that were used to prop up their lights 
            during the winter.</p>

    The five main days of Las Fallas — La Plantà — are celebrated from 15 to 19 March. More than 
    700 massive ninots (lifelike puppets) are set up around the city during this bustling 
    celebration, representing well-known Spanish celebrities or politicians. 
        <br><br>
        Las Fallas lasts for 20 days, from 1 to 19 March, and it features a pyrotechnic 
        spectacle of firecracker denotation and fireworks display called Mascletà. This 
        show happens every day at 2 p.m. in Plaza del Ayuntamiento.

            The ninots remain in place until the last day, March 19th, which is known as La 
            Cremà (the burning). On that evening, huge falles (torches) are set aflame and 
            the puppets are burnt. One of the ninots is spared from destruction by the popular
             vote and is exhibited in the local Fallas Museum along with the winners from the 
             previous years.
