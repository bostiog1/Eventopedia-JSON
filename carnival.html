    Other worth-experiencing carnivals in Spain include the thrilling Carnival of Sitges, a 
    favorite of the gay community, and the Carnival of Cádiz, an annual ten-day celebration 
    known for its sarcasm, and humor.
        <br><br>
        While the wildest festivities happen in Cadiz, Canary Islands and Sitges, there are also 
        thrilling carnivals in other Spanish destinations like Badajoz, Villarrobledo, 
        La Bañeza, Toro, Miguelturra, Herencia and La Vijanera in Cantabria.

            In Spain, there is typically a packed Carnival programme that lasts all week. It begins with 
            the arrival of the Carnival King or Queen, looking to spread joy and mischief 
            throughout the city, followed by parades, inventive costumes and music – usually 
            samba-style drumming from Brazil. The week ends with the Entierro de la Sardina, 
            or the Burial of the Sardine, a mock funeral procession 
            to say goodbye to the revelry and the Carnival King or Queen, before the start of Lent.
